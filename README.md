## What is 

$rName is a focused Android development assignment created to master foundational mobile engineering patterns. It explores Basic UI widgets and layouts through clean Android architecture guidelines.

## Why 

Mastering native Android development requires solid understanding of core framework components, UI lifecycles, and threading boundaries. This project provides hands-on practical implementation of Basic UI widgets and layouts without third-party abstraction overhead.

## API / Routes

### Core Activities & Components
- Main application controllers under pp/src/main/java/.
- XML layout definitions, strings, and drawables located in pp/src/main/res/.
- Gradle build configuration defined in pp/build.gradle.

## Examples

Standard Activity lifecycle logging and initialization pattern:

``java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    Log.d("projectSatu-android", "Activity initialized successfully");
}
``

## Architecture & Development Guides
